# **OceanRithm – Conceptual Research Portal**

OceanRithm is a research driven framework focused on advancing secure workflow governance, multi tenant abstraction models, and orchestration theory within modern DevSecOps ecosystems.

This portal presents an academically aligned, high level overview of the conceptual foundations behind OceanRithm — designed for:

- **Academic evaluation**
- **Peer review and publication processes**
- **Research supervision**
- **Strategic architectural assessment**

OceanRithm deliberately abstracts away implementation, deployment, and infrastructure specific details to preserve conceptual clarity and research integrity.  
The emphasis is on **principles, governance, identity boundaries, and secure orchestration logic**.
