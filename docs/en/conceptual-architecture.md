2. **Control Layer** – Coordinates high level workflow behavior.
3. **Governance Layer** – Represents theoretical policy concepts.
4. **Tenant Abstraction Layer** – Conceptual multi user separation.
5. **Observation Layer** – High level monitoring and research visibility.

### Notes
  No APIs are described.
  No system logic is included.
  Concepts are intentionally abstract.
