  Simple redirect page:
  - When the root (/) is opened, redirect immediately to ./en/
-->

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=./en/">

<script>
  // Fallback redirect in case the meta refresh does not work
  window.location.href = './en/';
</script>

If you are not redirected automatically, click [here](./en/).
